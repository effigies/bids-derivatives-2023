# The Evolution of BIDS Derivatives

## A brief history of derivatives

Feb 2016: Working document
: \- Initially covers coregistered volumes, affine/warp transforms, confound regressors, brain masks

<br>

Mar 2016 - Mar 2017
: \- Expansion: estimated field maps, artifact corrections, ROI masks, discrete and probabilistic segmentations, tracts/tractograms, diffusion maps
: \- Consolidation: artifact corrections and coregistrations become "minimally processed"
: \- Pipeline descriptions add coarse provenance

<br>

Apr 2017
: \- Dubbed "BEP 003: The BIDS Derivatives Specification"

<br>

Aug 2017: (BIDS Apps Workshop @ Stanford)
: \- BEP 003 becomes "Common Derivatives", BEPs 011-016 are spawned

## More history

Aug 2018: (BIDS Derivatives Workshop @ Stanford)
: \- Sub-BEPs worked on mostly independently
: \- "Common Derivatives" refined by polling sub-BEPs, finding the points of agreement

<br>

Dec 2018
: \- Release Candidate 1
  ([bids-spec#109](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pull/109))
  with large components of structural, functional, diffusion

<br>

Apr 2019
: \- Move to community-managed branch/PR 
  ([bids-spec#207](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pull/207))
: \- This turned out to be unreviewable, so...

<br>

Jul 2019
: \- Common Derivatives and BEPs 011, 012 and 016 return

<br>

Jun 2020
: \- Common derivatives are included in BIDS 1.4.0 release

### Non-compliant derivatives

> Nothing in this specification should be interpreted to disallow the storage/distribution
  of non-compliant derivatives of BIDS datasets. In particular, if a BIDS dataset contains
  a `derivatives/` subdirectory, the contents of that directory may be a heterogeneous mix
  of BIDS Derivatives datasets and non-compliant derivatives.

Many public datasets already include non-conformant derivatives. This balances attempts to
define validatable derivatives while not penalizing people for sharing before the spec
existed.

:::

## Dataset description

* New fields were introduced for *all* datasets:
  * `DatasetType` indicates `"raw"` or `"derivative"` data.
  * `GeneratedBy` contains references to the code (including versions)
    that produced the derivative dataset.
  * `SourceDatasets` is a list of references to the specific version of the
    dataset analyzed.

```{.json code-line-numbers=4|5-15|16-22}
{
  "Name": "FMRIPREP Outputs",
  "BIDSVersion": "1.4.0",
  "DatasetType": "derivative",
  "GeneratedBy": [
    {
      "Name": "fmriprep",
      "Version": "1.4.1",
      "Container": {"Type": "docker", "Tag": "poldracklab/fmriprep:1.4.1"}
    },
    {
      "Name": "Manual",
      "Description": "Re-added RepetitionTime metadata to bold.json files"
    }
  ],
  "SourceDatasets": [
    {
      "DOI": "doi:10.18112/openneuro.ds000114.v1.0.1",
      "URL": "https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000114/versions/1.0.1",
      "Version": "1.0.1"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Derivatives file-naming

* Form: `<source_entities>[_<key>-<value>]_<suffix>.<ext>`
* Rules:
  * Derivative files must have some way, such as a new entity or suffix,
    to distinguish them from raw files.
  * The free-form `desc-<label>` entity may be used in any derivative file.
  * "Source entities" should be preserved unless they no longer apply.
    * For example, combining across runs, the `run-<index>` entity should be dropped.
  * Raw files may be included in a derivatives dataset without additional entities.

Additionally, the `space-<label>` entity is almost always permissible to indicate
resampled data.

## Derivatives common metadata

* Most metadata is optional but encouraged.
* Raw metadata that still applies to derivatives should be propagated.
* Free-text `"Description"` is always RECOMMENDED.
* `"Sources"` is always at least OPTIONAL (specific derivatives can make RECOMMENDED or REQUIRED).

::: {.fragment}

### Spatial references

* `"SpatialReference"` provides an explicit link to local or remote files.
* BIDS defines standard template identifiers
  (see [Appendix: Coordinate systems](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/appendices/coordinate-systems.html#standard-template-identifiers)).
  `space-MNI305`, for example, does not require `"SpatialReference"`.
* In the absence of explicit entities/metadata, an image is in space `"orig"` and is its own reference.
* If the `<label>` in `space-<label>` is not part of the BIDS-defined standard template identifiers,
  `SpatialReference` is required.

:::

## Preprocessed or cleaned data

<br>

> Data is considered to be *preprocessed* or *cleaned* if the data type of the input,
  as expressed by the BIDS `suffix`, is unchanged.

<br>

Template:

```text
<pipeline_name>/
    sub-<label>/
        <datatype>/
            <source_entities>[_space-<space>][_desc-<label>]_<suffix>.<ext>
```

Examples:

```
pipeline1/
  sub-01/
    anat/
      sub-01_space-MNI305_T1w.nii.gz
      sub-01_space-MNI305_T1w.json
    eeg/
      sub-01_task-rest_desc-filtered_eeg.edf
      sub-01_task-rest_desc-filtered_eeg.json
    func/
      sub-01_task-rest_space-MNI305_desc-preproc_bold.nii.gz
      sub-01_task-rest_space-MNI305_desc-preproc_bold.json
```

## Imaging derivatives

Some derivatives common to MRI modalities were encoded. With the addition of
electrophysiology and PET, these were reclassified from "common" to "imaging".

### Resampled volumes

Adds resolution (`res-<label>`) and density (`den-<label>`) entities:

```
fmriprep/
  sub-01/
    anat/
      sub-01_space-MNI152NLin2009cAsym_res-2_desc-preproc_T1w.nii.gz
    func/
      sub-01_task-rest_space-MNI152NLin2009cAsym_res-2_desc-preproc_bold.nii.gz
```

<br>

### Binary masks

```
manual_masks/
  sub-01/
    anat/
      sub-01_desc-lesion_mask.nii.gz
      sub-01_desc-lesion_mask.json
localizer/
  sub-01/
    func/
      sub-01_task-loc_space-individual_label-FFA_mask.nii.gz
      sub-01_task-loc_space-individual_label-FFA_mask.json
```

## Imaging derivatives (continued)

### Discrete and probabilistic segmentations

Example:

```
tissue_segmentation/
  desc-AAL_dseg.tsv
  desc-AAL_probseg.json
  sub-01/
    func/
      sub-01_task-rest_desc-AAL_dseg.nii.gz
      sub-01_task-rest_desc-AAL_probseg.nii.gz
```

Discrete segmentations are 3D images with integer values, following either
a default label convention or as specified in `dseg.tsv`:

```{.tsv filename="desc-AAL_dseg.tsv" code-line-numbers="false"}
index   name
1       Precentral_L
2       Precentral_R
3       Frontal_Sup_L
4       Frontal_Sup_R
...
```

Probabilistic/partial-volume segmentations are 4D images with values between
0 and 1, with labels identified in a corresponding JSON file:


```{.yaml filename="desc-AAL_probseg.json" code-line-numbers="false"}
{"LabelMap": ["Precentral_L", ...]}
```

# Other BEPs and Open Questions

## Possibly relevant precedents

### BEP011: Anatomical derivatives

* Surface-sampled measures (`_<suffix>.shape.gii`)
* Tabular morphometry statistics (`_morph.tsv`)

### BEP012: Functional derivatives

* Summary statistics (`_<mean|std|...>.nii.gz`)
* Time series
  * Generic, including ROI summary, time series (`_timeseries.<tsv|nii[.gz]>`)
  * Special cases (`_motion.tsv`, `_outliers.tsv`)
  * Spatiotemporal decompositions (`_<components|mixing>.<tsv|nii[.gz]>`)

### BEP014: Transformations and mappings

* Affine matrices (`_xfm.<ext>`)

## Possibly relevant precedents

### BEP016: Diffusion derivatives

* Model fit parameters (`_model.nii.gz`)
* Model-derived parameters (`_mdp.nii.gz`)
* `model-<label>` and `param-<label>` entities

### BEP038: Atlases

* Promotes `atlas-<label>` from [Imaging data types - Segmentations](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/05-derivatives/03-imaging.html#segmentations) to something subject-like
* Introduces some summary statistics in passing (c.f. BEP012)

### BEP039: Dimensionality reduction-based networks

* `group/` and `group-<label>/` replacing `sub-<label>/`
* `model-<label>/` directory under datatype (`anat/`, `pet/`, etc.)

### BEP028: BIDS Provenance

* JSON-LD files at file (`*_prov.jsonld`) and/or dataset (`/prov.jsonld`) level.

## Open questions

* Group "subjects" 
  * Status quo: Drop subject label when combining across subjects
  * Bare `group/` with no subject labels?
  * `group-<label>/` that acts like a subject?
  * `group-<label>/` that is an additional level (e.g., `group-A/[sub-01/]`)?

. . .

* Additional levels in the hierarchy
  * BEP-039 introduces `model-<label>/` at bottom of hierarchy.
  * FitLins (BEP-002 Stats Models implementation) uses `node-<label>/` at top of hierarchy.

. . .

* N-dimensional array files ([bids-spec#197](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/issues/197))
  * Not obviously relevant to PET, but it may come up


## Opinionated advice

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

* There is a tendency to try to specify everything, and pull back to the least common denominator.
  * There will be things you think are important that have to get dropped.
  * For example, we had individual derivatives for motion correction, bias field correction,
    resampling.
    They are now covered by `space-<label>` and `desc-<label>`.

:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

* Every rule needs implementing at least twice.
  * Prioritize validator, then producers, then consumers.
  * Minimizing new concepts eases implementation.

:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

* Detailed provenance should probably target BEP028. Resist the urge to specify everything in JSON.
  * You need enough for humans to follow along, and downstream tools to make decisions.
  * Tools can still add what their authors and users think is important.
